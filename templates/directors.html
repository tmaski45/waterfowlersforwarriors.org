                I would like to welcome each and every one of you. I Served in the USAF Nuclear ICBM missile weapons
                systems for almost 8 years. Been married to my lovely Bride Belinda since 1987, both incredible wife and mother. We have two sons Zachary,  born as a military brat in North Dakota and Brady who is currently enlisted in the USMC both great kids. I have had the opportunity to have resided and hunted all over the northern states and Canada. From the Rocky Mountains to Fly-in hunts in Northern Quebec. My wife and I were born and raised in Michigan we have lived in N. Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Idaho and Alaska. Too often people forget this great country we live in and take stuff for granted. Also they forget the reason our country is so great is because of the men and women that defend it. So a salute and a big thanks, May god bless You all. I look forward to meeting each of you and look forward to a life long friendship, bond and brotherhood. You will not find a closer tight knit organization anywhere. I am always just a phone call away at any time.

                My name is Belinda Fowler. I am married to the wonderful man, Scott, who is responsible for putting this organization together. We got married in 1987, right after his basic training from the Air Force which he served almost 8 years. We were stationed in North Dakota and Montana. Both states we met wonderful people, both in the service and out, that we are still in touch with. I don't regret the decision we made. I work for the Department of Human Services in Bay City. We have 2 wonderful boys who both enjoy hunting with their father and support the military strongly. I have done my fair share of hunting in the past to include shooting small game, birds, deer, antelope, caribou, wild boar, bear, buffalo and a Hawaiian sheep. Although gopher hunting in Montana was my favorite. Shooting clay targets is not my strong point as I miss a lot of them. I enjoy spending time with my family whether it is indoors or outdoors, and helping raise money for our well deserved military. Thank you everyone who has served, or is currently serving.
